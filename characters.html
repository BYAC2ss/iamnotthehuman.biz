      <p><b>Role:</b> Main heroine</p>
      <p><b>Voice Actor:</b> Asami Seto</p>
      <p>A famous actress who suddenly stops being recognized by people due to Adolescence Syndrome.</p>
      <p>Despite her calm and confident personality, she hides deep insecurities about being forgotten.</p>
      <p>Intelligent, mature, and strong-willed — yet she shows a softer, caring side only to Sakuta.</p>

      <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Her birthday is December 2. She loves strawberry milk and teasing Sakuta with witty remarks.</p>
